## Automated Promo Creator
A simple Python tool that automatically creates a short promo video from a longer input video by selecting the most dynamic scenes.

⚙️ How It Works:
-Splits the video into segments
-Detects motion using frame variance
-Picks the most active clips
-Merges them into a 1-minute promo (Here the time duration of the final promo can be altered according to the requirements)
